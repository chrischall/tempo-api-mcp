Tempo API MCP server for Claude — developed and maintained by AI (Claude Code)

## Confirmations

Every write (create/update/delete, and the timesheet submit/approve/reject/reopen/recall actions) asks the user to confirm before it changes anything: a confirmation prompt where the client supports one; otherwise the first call returns a preview of exactly what would be sent plus a `confirmToken`, and only a repeat call with that token proceeds.

| variable | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_CONFIRM_MODE` | `ask-user` | What a write does on a client that cannot show a confirmation prompt (claude.ai, Claude Desktop). `ask-user`: two steps — the first call does nothing and returns a preview plus a token, and the model must get your approval in chat before calling again with it. `auto`: the same two steps, but the model may use the token after reviewing the preview itself. `refuse`: writes are refused on such clients. A client that can show prompts (Claude Code) always gets the real prompt. An unrecognised value is treated as `refuse`. |
| `MCP_CONFIRM_TTL_SECONDS` | `600` | How long a token stays valid. |
| `MCP_CONFIRM_SECRET` | random per process | Signing key; set it only if tokens must survive a server restart. |
